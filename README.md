### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ernesto Gregori and I am a data scientist with strong background in mathematics and machine learning.

I hold a **master's degree in Big Data** from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and a **bachelor's degree in Physics** from Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid.

I work as **Junior Data Scientist** at [Innaxis](https://innaxis.aero/) (Madrid). So far, I have worked in two European projects:
* [Dispatcher3](https://dispatcher3.eu/), a Horizon 2020 project where I applied Machine Learning to estimate the variability between planned and executed flight plans prior departure. More specifically, I focused on predicting the fuel consumption of aircrafts.
* [Modus](https://modus-project.eu/), a SESAR project where I modelled door-to-door journeys in intermodal transport systems. More specifically, I focused on simulating complete passenger journeys involving both air and rail transport.

For these project, my main tools were:
* **Spark (Databricks)** to collect and process the data with **AWS**.
* **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** to design models.
* **HyperOpt** and **MLflow** to optimize and track models.
